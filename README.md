# python-collaboration

We are making Python-based password generator designed to create strong, secure passwords for users. This project aims to provide a user-friendly experience that allows users to generate passwords based on specific criteria, such as length, inclusion of special characters, numbers, and uppercase/lowercase letters. It will also allow you to store and save passwords for different websites.


Key Features:

Customizable password generation (length, character types, etc.)
Password strength evaluation
User-friendly command-line and/or GUI interface
Option to copy generated passwords to the clipboard
Potential integration with password managers
Open-source and community-driven development
